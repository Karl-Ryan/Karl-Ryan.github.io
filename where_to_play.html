<h3>SPECIAL OPS</h3>
<p>
For a Great outdoors type of a vibe head down to Special Ops Airsoft near Bray,
The most notable "stages" in Spec-ops must be "the village", the "castle" and most importantly "The Bad Lands", each with their own themes.
It's easy to say that Spec-Ops will never fail to impress.
NOTE: At spec ops there are also options for Paintball, camping, Bush grafts and even TANK driving.</p><a href="https://www.specialops.ie/">

<p></p><br>
<h3>Scribblestown</h3>
<p>
Thirdly I'd like to mention are very own local Airsoft site <b>Scribblestown</b>.
Scribblestown Airsoft is located 15 to 20 minotes drive from TU Dublin Blanchardstown and gives a fully authentic rustic style of game play,
Bosting that its ground layout is modular meaning the area of Game play can change when ever needed,
allowing Scribblestown to maintain a fresh/new feeling and preventing anyone from getting overly familiar with the area.

<h2>"Airsoft" in Irish Law</h2>
<p>
Airsoft guns first became legal in Ireland when the 2006 Criminal Justice Act altered the Firearms Acts.
A firearm is defined as: "an air gun (including an air rifle and air pistol) with a muzzle energy greater than one joule or any other weapon incorporating a barrel from which any projectile can be discharged with such muzzle energy"
<a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/act/2006/26/eng/enacted/a2606.pdf" title="Criminal Justice Act 2006:">Criminal Justice Act 2006:</a>  2006/A2606.pdf
As such, any airsoft gun that has a muzzle energy of one joule or less is no longer classified as a firearm.
There is no license required for an airsoft gun.
Airsoft guns are now classed as Realistic Imitation Firearms (RIF) and cannot be carried in public at ANY TIME.
If you are carrying your RIF to your car, It MUST be in a suitable case.
Penalties for carrying a RIF in a public place include up to a &euro;5000 fine or imprisonment up to 5 years, or both.</p>
<p>
At what age can I buy an Airsoft RIF?
You must be 18 years or older to buy any Airsoft RIF from Most Stores.
Under 18s must be accompanied by a parent or guardian when entering a store,
If you attempt to purchase an airsoft Rif from a store and cannot provide a valid Proof of age,
"Driving Licence/Passport/Garda Age Card" you will not be sold the device.</p>

<h3>How powerful can airsoft guns be?</h3>
<p>All airsoft guns should comply with Irish law as such all Airsoft guns must be below 1 Joule of energy.
100 Mtrs or 328 Fps equates to 1 Joule of energy tested to industry standard with 0.2g BBs with the use of a Chronograph.
